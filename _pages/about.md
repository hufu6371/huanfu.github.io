I currently serve as a Principal Researcher at Futurise, an AGI startup. Previously, I was the Staff Algorithm Expert (P8) at Taobao, Alibaba, where I led a team primarily focused on NeRF. 

I got my Ph.D. from The University of Sydney (USYD) in 2019 under the guidance of [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html), with co-supervision from [Prof. Chaohui Wang](https://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~cwang/index.php) and [Prof. Mingming Gong](https://mingming-gong.github.io/). Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2014. 

Right now, I'm into researching 3D reconstruction/generation, NeRF, and image generation.
